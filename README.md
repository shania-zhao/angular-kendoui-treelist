# AngularKendouiTreelist

Because Kendo UI for Angular doesn't have TreeList Component, use Kendo UI for jQuery to take the place of it.
You should have jQuery and Kendo UI for jQuery library.
Then put them in the [angualr.json].

## Usage

Declare [$] and [kendo] before use it.

declare var $: any;
declare var kendo: any;

## Running

ng serve
